IMPORTANT: Do not distribute DLV binaries!

cygwin.dll and windows port of dlv "dlv.cygwin.exe" are officially not available since cygwin requires DLV to be open source which it is not and therefore violates the license.

The native linux version of DLV has a propriatery license. It is not yet clarified if we are allowed to distribute it.
